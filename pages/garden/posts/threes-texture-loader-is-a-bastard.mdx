## The Good

Orb.

## The Abundantly Bad

So I had the intention of writing this up quickly in the morning to experiment with applying an image texture to a mesh and it lead me down a rabit hole of React-y problems.

Here's the WORKING code for the orb:

```jsx
//Orb.js
import { useRef } from "react"
import { useFrame } from "@react-three/fiber"
import { useTexture } from "@react-three/drei"
import { Sphere } from "@react-three/drei"

const Orb = () => {
  const orbRef = useRef(null)
  const texture = useTexture("/textures/missing-texture.png")
  useFrame(
    () => (orbRef.current.rotation.x = orbRef.current.rotation.y += 0.01)
  )

  return (
    <Sphere ref={orbRef} castShadow args={[3, 80, 80]}>
      <meshStandardMaterial map={texture} />
    </Sphere>
  )
}

export default Orb
```

This is what the [R3F docs](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/loading-textures) want you to do:

```jsx
//TextureLoader example from their site
import React, { Suspense } from "react"
import { Canvas, useLoader } from "@react-three/fiber"
import { TextureLoader } from "three/src/loaders/TextureLoader"

function Scene() {
  const [colorMap] = useLoader(TextureLoader, ["PavingStones092_1K_Color.jpg"])
  return (
    <>
      <ambientLight intensity={0.2} />
      <directionalLight />
      <mesh>
        <sphereGeometry args={[1, 100, 100]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial />
      </mesh>
    </>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Canvas>
        <Suspense fallback={null}>
          <Scene />
        </Suspense>
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Which, I'm sure, is fine in most contexts, but Next was putting up a STINK.

<Image
  src="/images/next-js-error-output.png"
  alt={`The error reads as: Server Error/ SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module. module.exports = requre("three/src/loaders/TextureLoader");`}
  mb="1rem"
  border="1px solid"
  borderColor="gray.400"
  borderRadius={4}
  boxShadow="md"
  overflow="hidden"
/>

I was about to give up and go lay face-down on the lawn when I found [this hook](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#usetexture) in the drei docs. `useTexture` solved whatever import muckery was going on. All I had to do was define my texture and pass the hook a url and we were back in business.

```js
const texture = useTexture("/textures/missing-texture.png")
```

## I guess the takeaway here is:

- To the best of my knowledge, this is specific to Nextjs apps
- Whenever possible, be diligent with reading over the drei docs to see if there's a helper to solve these headaches for you
- There are seemingly endless solves on stackoverflow and github, and sometimes none of them line up with your specific use case
- 3D hard
- It's okay to cry ðŸ˜­
- orb
