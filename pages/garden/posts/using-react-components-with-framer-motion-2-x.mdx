So you've finished building out a design for a page. You've picked up some sort of styled component library to keep everything consistent. You take a moment to admire the perfect padding. The Tasteful, yet spicy font choices. The color palette? Immaculate.

> Hmm. Could use a little more pizzazz.

Heartbreak.

You visit [the Framer Motion API docs](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) and add this snazzy little library to your project.

Oh...

```jsx
<motion.Heading>Animate me!</motion.Heading>
```

didn't work.

No problem, we'll just wrap the component in a `<motion.div></motion.div>`.

```jsx
<motion.div>
  <Heading>Animate Me!</Heading>
</motion.div>
```

**NO!**

While this works, It's not ideal and just continues to add to your ever-growing div soup. Let's try this sweet method out.

```jsx
const MotionHeading = motion.custom(Heading)

<MotionHeading>
  Animate Me!
</MotionHeading>
```

And just like that, you're now able to access the framer-motion props while being able to style away with the props of the ui library you've come to know and love. Just a little less div clutter in your life.

I had a hard time finding about this in the framer-motion docs, so I hope this helps someone out there running into the same thing.
