When the Big 'Vid blew up the world last year, one of the few feelings of normalcy I kept was going to The Market in my city and picking up pupusas from my friend's spot. Then, one day, _poof_. The CloudWaitress shop was gone, the website's shop was closed, all out of the blue. My friend and I got to talking the following weekend and I brought it up-

> "So uh- What happened to the curbside pickup?"

No tea, no shade, no pink lemonade; her previous webmaster ghosted, and with her, the online store.

I mentioned that I had spent the last year getting into web dev and would love to help out with setting up a new site. After messaging back and forth and a meeting, we came to an agreement and I began planning.

I had to comb over so many options- the e-commerce space isn't by any means saturated, but there are a TON of solutions.

In the end, I landed on this stack:

- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gb-ca)
- [use-shopping-cart](https://useshoppingcart.com/)
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)
- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [(Technically Github Actions for handling deployment)](https://github.com/XanderJL/true-taco/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)

## Build It, and... Run Into Limitations

Originally, I thought I'd be able to bang this project out in two weeks. ha👏ha👏

![Side-eyeing monkey puppet](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/030/710/dd0.jpg)

Getting started with Stripe was probably one of the biggest hurdles. So much of their API is disjointed, so many ways to achieve the same thing. Do you want to use [SKUs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/skus)? Nope- that's being dropped in favour of their [Price API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices). Well, alright then- I guess I can add the items in the products section of the dashboard. Great! Except there's character limits on the descriptions, anything remotely dynamic has to be stored as key:val pairs in metadata, which there are multiple spots for. The whole thing is a mess to navigate as a beginner.

I was using the [gatsby-source-stripe](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-stripe/?=source%20str) plugin in tandem with fighting with the Stripe dashboard to create products. I was actually running with that solution until I got a few weeks away from the launch. I switched to building products with a schema [use-shopping-cart](https://useshoppingcart.com/getting-started) expected in Sanity, and then bringing them into my site with [gatsby-source-sanity](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-sanity).

```jsx
import React from "react"

const chiles = () => {
  return <img src="../static/icons/dos-chiles.svg" alt="" />
}

export default {
  name: "product",
  title: "Product",
  icon: chiles,
  type: "document",
  initialValue: {
    active: true,
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: "title",
      title: "Title",
      description:
        "The product’s name, meant to be displayable to the customer. Whenever this product is
            sold via a subscription, name will show up on associated invoice line item
            descriptions.",
      type: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "productId",
      title: "Product ID",
      type: "slug",
      description:
        "Necessary for Stripe to not throw a fit when a customer goes to check out. Make sure
            to click the generate button after giving your item a title!",
      options: {
        source: "title",
      },
      validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
    },
    {
      name: "description",
      title: "Description",
      description:
        "The product’s description, meant to be displayable to the customer. Use this field to
            optionally store a long form explanation of the product being sold for your own
            rendering purposes.",
      type: "text",
      rows: 4,
    },
    {
      name: "active",
      title: "Active",
      description:
        "Whether the product is currently available for purchase. Defaults to true.",
      type: "boolean",
    },
    {
      name: "menu",
      title: "Menu",
      type: "reference",
      to: [{ type: "subMenu" }],
      validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
    },
    {
      name: "price",
      title: "Price",
      type: "number",
      validation: (rule) => rule.precision(2),
    },
    {
      name: "stock",
      title: "Stock",
      type: "number",
    },
    {
      name: "image",
      title: "Image",
      description: "Meant to be displayable to the customer.",
      type: "productImage",
      options: { hotspot: true },
    },
    {
      name: "fillings",
      title: "Fillings",
      type: "array",
      of: [{ type: "string" }],
    },
    {
      name: "options",
      title: "Options",
      type: "array",

      of: [{ type: "productOption" }],
    },
    {
      name: "extras",
      title: "Extras",
      type: "array",
      of: [
        {
          type: "reference",
          to: {
            type: "product",
          },
          options: {
            filter: "menu._ref == $menu",
            filterParams: {
              menu: "99df0625-2558-4b36-bc53-469a3a0cbe15",
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  preview: {
    select: {
      title: "title",
      subtitle: "description",
      media: "image.image",
    },
  },
}
```

So what exactly is going on in this block? We're creating a new product that takes a name (title, in this case), product ID, a product description, an image (don't forget the alt text!), an array of available fillings, options for different tortillas, masa, pricing in general, etc. and an array of available extras. A few nice-to-haves in here are custom preview icons to theme the CMS a little bit, a field to set the products under a sub-menu (I'll touch on that later), and an active boolean to hide menu items if she runs out of stock or no longer wants to offer the item- you get the idea.

Please feel free to dig through the rest of my [Sanity setup](https://github.com/XanderJL/true-taco/tree/main/sanity), but I'm going to move on with bringing the data into Gatsby.

The most complicated part of this project is definitely the [menu](https://github.com/XanderJL/true-taco/tree/main/site/src/components/Menu). Again, feel free to have a poke around in there, but I'll just be going through the meat and potaties in this article.

This is the query bringing in all the bits and bobs from Sanity to build out the menu:

```jsx
const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
  {
    sanityMenu {
      isOpen
      heading
      menus {
        id
        title
      }
      _rawBody
      _rawOpenBody
    }
    allSanityProduct(filter: { active: { eq: true } }) {
      group(field: menu___title) {
        edges {
          node {
            menu {
              title
            }
            id
            productId {
              current
            }

            title
            description
            image {
              image {
                asset {
                  fluid(maxWidth: 800) {
                    ...GatsbySanityImageFluid
                  }
                }
                hotspot {
                  x
                  y
                  height
                  width
                }
              }
            }
            price
            fillings
            options {
              title
              price
            }
            extras {
              id
              title
              price
              options {
                title
                price
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`)
```

sanityMenu is pulling in a boolean to check if my friend is open for business, if it is, the site will render the menu, if not- there's an editable block that takes its place. allSanityProduct is pulling in... well, all of the products in Sanity.

Within the menu, a new section is rendered for each sub-menu listed in Sanity. As of writing this, there's breakfast, lunch, to-go, and extras. Each of them are rendered by this component. Nothing fancy going on:

```jsx
const SubMenu = menu => {
  return (
    <Grid
      m="0 auto 5rem auto"
      templateColumns={{
        base: "minmax(0, 1fr)",
        lg: "repeat(2, minmax(250px, 70ch))",
      }}
      gap={{ base: "2rem", md: "5rem" }}
    >
      {menu.data[0].edges.map(({ node }) => {
        const {
          id,
          productId,
          title,
          description,
          image,
          price,
          fillings,
          options,
        } = node

        return (
          <MenuItem
            key={id}
            heading={title}
            price={price}
            product={{
              id: productId.current,
              name: title,
              price: price * 100,
              image: image?.image.asset.fluid.src,
              currency: "CAD",
              description,
              price_data: {
                metadata: {},
              },
            }}
            metadata={{ options, fillings }}
          >
            <Text mb="1rem" fontSize="lg" color="white">
              {description}
            </Text>
          </MenuItem>
        )
      })}
    </Grid>
  )
}
```

The real juicy bit is this bad boy; the MenuItem component:

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import React, { useState } from "react"
import { css, jsx } from "@emotion/core"
import {
  Button,
  Flex,
  Heading,
  Select,
  Text,
  useDisclosure,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"
import { useShoppingCart } from "use-shopping-cart"
import ImageModal from "./ImageModal"

const MenuItem = ({ heading, price, children, product, metadata }) => {
  const { addItem } = useShoppingCart()

  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1)

  const itemFillings = metadata?.fillings

  const itemOptions = metadata?.options

  const [filling, setFilling] = useState(itemFillings && itemFillings[0])

  const [options, setOptions] = useState(itemOptions && itemOptions[0])

  const dotLeaders = css`
    &::after {
      float: right;
      width: 0;
      margin-left: 1.25rem;
      white-space: nowrap;
      content: ". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ";
    }
  `

  const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()

  const itemMatch =
    itemOptions.filter(item => item.title === options)[0] || options

  return (

    </Flex>
  )
}
```

There is A LOT going on in here, but here's the gist:

1. The most important prop here is product. You can see how that object is being set in the previous codeblock. It's pushing an object in the format that use-shopping-cart is expecting.
2. That product prop is being destructured and presented as a menu item using a bunch of fun styled components from Chakra and Emotion.
3. A combination of Chakra's Selectors and useState hooks are mutating the product data before it hits use-shopping-cart's addItem() method.
4. I want to touch on that addItem() bit for a second. At the time of writing this, Nick added a new argument that allowed for dynamic metadata entries to allow for products with the same name, but different fillings or price options, etc.

```jsx
addItem(
  {
    ...product,
    id: `${product.id}${options ? "-" + itemMatch.title : ""}${
      filling ? "-" + filling : ""
    }`,
    description: `${
      filling
        ? `Filling: ${filling}, ${product.description}`
        : product.description
    }`,
    price: itemMatch ? itemMatch.price * 100 : price * 100,
  },
  quantity,
  {
    metadata: { filling, variant: itemMatch && itemMatch.title },
  }
)
```

The first argument is spreading the existing product object, dynamically changing the id's string based on what options the customer picks, the description is likewise being dynamically changed to display what variant they've chosen in the [Stripe checkout session](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions). The price, again, is dynamically added based on what option the customer selects and is then massaged to be in the format Stripe expects in a [line_item](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items-price_data-unit_amount). The second argument is simply passing the quantity of the product the customer wants to add, and the last arg is that secret sauce. That chef's kiss. It's what's allowing me to have multiple entries of the same product with variations. It's passing an object to price_data in the line_item.

Once the customer has put together a lil' cart for themselves, the bottom of the menu, or the top right corner of the navbar have CTAs to proceed to checkout. They're brought to [this page](https://truetacolondon.com/cart/). As long as there are items in their cart, they will be rendered in an accordion component that will display the variation and filling of a product, along with an adjustable quantity selector and a remove from cart button. There's also a pickup time picker and notes section that both get passed to the [create-session](https://github.com/XanderJL/true-taco/blob/main/site/functions/create-session.js) serverless function, which we'll touch on next.

```js
const stripe = require("stripe")(process.env.GATSBY_STRIPE_API_SECRET)

exports.handler = async ({ body }) => {
  const { cart, metadata, subtotal } = JSON.parse(body)

  try {

This function is largely ripped from the example on [USC](https://useshoppingcart.com/getting-started#serverless-implementation)'s site and this [Netlify blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/13/learn-how-to-accept-money-on-jamstack-sites-in-38-minutes/). The main difference with my implementation is that I'm reshaping the data coming from USC and adding a few of my own bits. As of the time of writing this, Stripe has an opt-in beta for adding taxes to your checkout session, but it's only available in the US. I've created a line_item called hst that calculates the HST for the subtotal of the cart. In my stripe.checkout.sessions.create instance, I'm spreading the newly created line_items with my custom tax implementation and adding the pickup time and notes from the cart page in the metadata of the session.

At this point, that's TECHNICALLY all that's necessary to check the sale on the Stripe dashboard and proceed with order fulfilment, but that's not exactly a user friendly approach. Enter [Stripe webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks). I create an endpoint in the dashboard, something to the effect of `https://<url>/.netlify/functions/payment-confirmation` that listens for the checkout.session.completed event.

Here's the spicy bit. Keep in mind a good majority of this function is a raw html template (god, I hate email) that formats the checkout session data in a simple table that is then emailed with Mailgun, wrapped in a promise, to my friend's inbox as a form of "e-chit", I'll call it.

```js
const Stripe = require("stripe")

const stripe = Stripe(process.env.GATSBY_STRIPE_API_SECRET, {
  maxNetworkRetries: 3,
})

const mailgun = require("mailgun-js")({
  apiKey: process.env.MAILGUN_API_KEY,
  domain: process.env.MAILGUN_DOMAIN,
  url: process.env.MAILGUN_URL,
})

exports.handler = async ({ body, headers }) => {
  try {
    const stripeEvent = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
      body,
      headers["stripe-signature"],
      process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
    )

    if (stripeEvent.type === "checkout.session.completed") {
      const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve(
        JSON.parse(body).data.object.id,
        { expand: ["line_items.data.price.product", "customer"] }
      )
