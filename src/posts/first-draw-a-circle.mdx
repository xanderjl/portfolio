## Baby Steps

A friend of mine lent me a copy of [Sacred Geometry: Deciphering the Code](https://www.amazon.ca/Sacred-Geometry-Deciphering-Stephen-Skinner/dp/1402765827), and it's inspired me. I don't buy into the mysticism behind it, but I am very intrigued by how it works. I want to recreate [The Flower of Life](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1226/1682/files/flower_of_life_large.png?v=1572056272), and I figure learning how to render a circle is the first step to doing so.

### Here's the code snippet for rendering the circle:

```jsx
// Circle.js

import { Line } from "@react-three/drei"

const Circle = ({ radius, ...rest }) => {
  const points = []
  const rad = (radius && radius) || 10

  for (let i = 0; i <= 360; i++) {
    points.push(
      Math.sin(i * (Math.PI / 180)) * rad,
      Math.cos(i * (Math.PI / 180)) * rad,
      0
    )
  }

  return <Line points={points} color="black" lineWidth={6} {...rest} />
}

export default Circle
```

Really looking forward to making this thing a reality ðŸ‘€
